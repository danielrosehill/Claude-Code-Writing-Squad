# Sample Input Text

This is a sample text file that demonstrates the Claude Code Writing Squad processing pipeline. Replace this content with your own text that you want to process through the agent system.

## About This File

This file serves as the input for the automated processing script. When you run `python process_text.py`, the script will:

1. Read the content from this file
2. Process it through each agent in sequence
3. Save intermediate results for review
4. Output the final processed text to `output.md`

## Example Content

Here's some example content to demonstrate the processing:

The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. This sentence contains every letter of the alphabet and is commonly used for testing purposes. It's a pangram - a sentence that uses every letter of the alphabet at least once.

Some facts that might need sources:
- The first computer was invented in 1943
- London has a population of approximately 9 million people
- The speed of light is 299,792,458 meters per second

## Instructions

To use this system:

1. Replace this content with your own text
2. Run the processing script: `python process_text.py`
3. Review the results in `output.md` and the `intermediate/` directory

The agents will work together to improve your text through typo correction, UK English standardisation, flow improvement, heading structure, fact-checking, source addition, and SEO optimization.
