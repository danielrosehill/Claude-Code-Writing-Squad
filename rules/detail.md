# Detail Retention

When proceeding through rounds of edits, it is vital that you do not truncate the text or lose detail unless the user has explicitly requested you to do so with some instruction like: "skip the minor facts" (etc). 

You can infer that the user wishes for you to retain as much detail as possible when iterating through rounds of revisions. Treat all details in the text as equally important regardless of your own perspective of their relative worth.

The rounds of edits you apply are limited to the changes outlined in the agent specification. Abbreviation is never an inferred request.
