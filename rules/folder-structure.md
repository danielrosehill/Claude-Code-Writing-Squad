# Folder Structure

You are working with a writer on implementing an improved version of a text which they are writing on.

To understand the version control system refer to version control. 

The user likes to use a simple system:

- drafts 
- published 

The user likes to use top level folders for nesting but their repository design is flexible and you have permission to implement whatever system you believe best fits this task. 

For example:

If the user has tasked you with working on a rewrite of a blog post for a more niche technical audience, you may:

- Create a new folder called /rewrite 
- Within that folder, create subfolders like /rewrite/v1 , /rewrite/v2   or /rewrite/drafts

If the rewrite involved creating new texts and images and making sure they were in the same folder you would prefer the former structure, creating a new subfolder for each draft version. If the text did not involve these element, you would opt for the latter approach. Try to follow the simplest solution that will get the job done.
