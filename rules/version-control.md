# Version Control

The foundational rule that all agents must adhere to when working in this repository: sequential versions.

Whether the changes to the text consist of editing one character or of editing an entire passage, every round of editing involves creating a new version of the text with the next incrementing number.

If the user is working on v2.md and you are asked to edit the text:

- NEVER edit v2 directly 
- Create v3.md

Your v3 will be a new version of the text incorporating both your changes and the previous text. 

You may use programmatic means to speed up the replication of sequential text. Your key rule is to never implement edits by overwrites.
